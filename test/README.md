# /test

The *official* stardust test suite. Organized into a few key components:

- `/test/benchmarks`: Various performance benchmarks, for testing new perf changes
- `/test/semantics`: Organized into pass/fail, things that should work and things that shouldn't (mostly for validating type coersion logic)
- `/test/syntax`: Code examples, used for testing scanner/parser
