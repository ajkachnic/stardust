# Stardust Zen

*A set of axioms which the semantics, syntax, and ergonomics of the language are both off of*

- Moderation is a virtue
- Only one obvious way to do things
- The right way to do it should be the easiest way
- Plan for failure, not success
- Runtime crashes are better than bugs
- Don't be optimistic, don't be pesimistic, be pragmatic
- Use the right tool for the job
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- The best rules are meant to be broken
